					<p>For All Paws is an animal shelter founded by Jacob Helton, Autumn Alston, and Lily Tran to help animals in need within the community of Chesterfield. Our mission was first thought of when Autumn Alston saw an extremely emotional commercial showing the inhumane treatment of animals. Naturally, Autumn called on two of her closest friends and coworkers; Jacob Helton and Lily Tran to aid her in her venture. The natural affinity to dogs, cats, and goats that Jacob, Autumn, and Lily share is the glue which holds <b><i>For All Paws Animal Shelter</i></b>  together to this day.</p>
